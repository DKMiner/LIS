# LIS
A very simple and lightweight Laboratory Information System, written in Python

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



I know this could be done with a lot of other modules, less coding, better functions, etc. but it was a uni project for elementary programming, so I couldn't do a lot of stuff      outside of what they taught us (it already has a lot of stuff they never taught us)

So I made this, and tried to make it as perfect as possible. Can be better, so feel free to change it as much as you like :D


**First-time use**

The program will ask for a name, an email (used for sending emails) and then a password. You can use an app password



**How to get an app password**

Go to [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com), login into the email you entered for LIS program, and choose "Security". Enable 2-step verification from there if you    already haven't turned it on. The on the main page, in "Security" tab again, under "How you sign in to Google" choose 2-Step Verification (not 2-Step Verification phones), then     scroll all the way down to find "App passwords". In the new page, choose "select app", then choose "other (custom name)". Enter a name for you passwrod, and click "Generate".       Done! You can now use this for this LIS program so it will be able to send emails with the entered email.



**Known issues**

This code will hve problems with system path when you run in inside VS Code or any other coding application/IDE. ***It must be running using a terminal***



**To-do**

1. Probably use "num_ask()" for all inputs
2. Change database from txt to json or something better
3. Data encryption
4. GUI

1. ThePycoach for their email sending code. Used it as a function in this program. The code can be found in [here](https://github.com/thepycoach/automation/blob/main/Send%20Emails.py)

2. My friend [Light7734](https://github.com/Light7734), for giving me advice on coding, teaching me stuff, and reviewing my code. (Still didn't do as he told me on changing this code, lol)
